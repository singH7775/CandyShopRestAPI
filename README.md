A simple REST API I made that provides three tables holding the customer, candies, and orders. Set up a OneToMany and ManyToOne relationship and used an in memory H2 database for efficiency.
Also implemented a JWT authentication which provides users with a HMAC-SHA512 signed token

I will look to do some tests on this API and document it after I have added some more complex conditions, but this is a checkpoint for me
